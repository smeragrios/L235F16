Welcome 2 my homepage :   ). I was born on November 30th 1996 in the State of New York. Photos are very scary things to me as I do not know what exactly is captured in an image besides for just the image itself it could really be any number of things example A stare your "soul" your body then this image of your face your eyes the expression on your face when you smile is disseminated to other eyes who consume you really the whole thing just freaks me out.... and then damn all of the images colors highly formalized compositions with visual refrences which are meant to entice me thrill me wash over me make me happy comfort family goes on vacation four person family goes to so island "have the time of your life"
